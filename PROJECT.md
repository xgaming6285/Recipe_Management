Full-Stack App Plan: : "RecipeHub" - A
Recipe Management App
This app will allow users to create, store, and share recipes. It will demonstrate MongoDB's
capabilities for storing unstructured data (e.g., recipes with varying ingredients and steps),
querying, and relationships between collections (e.g., users and recipes).
Tech Stack
1. Frontend: React.js (with Tailwind CSS for styling)
2. Backend: Node.js with Express.js
3. Database: MongoDB (with Mongoose for schema modeling)
4. Authentication: JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
5. Deployment:
 - Frontend: Vercel or Netlify
 - Backend: Render or AWS
 - Database: MongoDB Atlas (cloud-hosted MongoDB)
Features
1. User Authentication:
 - Sign up, log in, and log out.
 - JWT-based authentication for secure access.
2. Recipe Management:
 - Create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) recipes.
 - Each recipe will include:
 - Title
 - Description
 - Ingredients (array of strings)
 - Steps (array of strings)
 - Image URL (optional)
 - Cooking time
 - Category (e.g., breakfast, lunch, dinner, dessert)
3. User Profile:
 - Users can view their profile with a list of their created recipes.
4. Search and Filter:
 - Search recipes by title or ingredients.
 - Filter recipes by category or cooking time.
5. Responsive Design:
 - The app will be mobile-friendly and responsive.
Database Schema
MongoDB will store data in the following collections:
1. Users Collection:
 {
 "_id": ObjectId,
 "username": String,
 "email": String,
 "password": String (hashed),
 "createdAt": Date,
 "updatedAt": Date
 }
2. Recipes Collection:
 {
 "_id": ObjectId,
 "title": String,
 "description": String,
 "ingredients": [String],
 "steps": [String],
 "imageUrl": String,
 "cookingTime": Number,
 "category": String,
 "createdBy": ObjectId (reference to Users collection),
 "createdAt": Date,
 "updatedAt": Date
 }
API Endpoints
1. Auth Routes:
 - `POST /api/auth/signup` - User registration.
 - `POST /api/auth/login` - User login.
2. Recipe Routes:
 - `GET /api/recipes` - Get all recipes (with optional search/filter queries).
 - `GET /api/recipes/:id` - Get a single recipe by ID.
 - `POST /api/recipes` - Create a new recipe (protected route).
 - `PUT /api/recipes/:id` - Update a recipe (protected route).
 - `DELETE /api/recipes/:id` - Delete a recipe (protected route).
3. User Routes:
 - `GET /api/users/me` - Get the current user's profile (protected route).
 - `GET /api/users/me/recipes` - Get all recipes created by the current user (protected route).
Frontend Pages
1. Home Page:
 - Displays a list of all recipes with search and filter options.
2. Recipe Detail Page:
 - Shows the full details of a recipe.
3. Create/Edit Recipe Page:
 - A form for creating or editing a recipe.
4. User Profile Page:
 - Displays the user's profile and their created recipes.
5. Login/Signup Page:
 - Forms for user authentication.
Development Plan
1. Week 1: Set up the project.
 - Initialize the backend (Node.js + Express).
 - Set up MongoDB Atlas and connect it to the backend.
 - Initialize the frontend (React.js).
2. Week 2: Implement user authentication.
 - Create user schema and routes for signup/login.
 - Implement JWT-based authentication.
3. Week 3: Build recipe management features.
 - Create recipe schema and routes for CRUD operations.
 - Implement frontend pages for creating, editing, and viewing recipes.
4. Week 4: Add search and filter functionality.
 - Implement backend logic for searching and filtering recipes.
 - Add search and filter components to the frontend.
5. Week 5: Polish and deploy.
 - Add styling using Tailwind CSS.
 - Test the app thoroughly.
 - Deploy the frontend, backend, and database.
MongoDB Features Demonstrated
1. Flexible Schema:
 - Recipes can have varying numbers of ingredients and steps.
2. CRUD Operations:
 - Create, read, update, and delete recipes.
3. Relationships:
 - Linking recipes to users via `createdBy` field.
4. Querying:
 - Searching and filtering recipes using MongoDB queries.
5. Scalability:
 - Using MongoDB Atlas for cloud-based database management.
Stretch Goals
1. Social Features:
 - Allow users to like and comment on recipes.
2. Image Upload:
 - Integrate a service like Cloudinary for image uploads.
3. Advanced Search:
 - Add full-text search using MongoDB's text index.
This plan ensures a well-rounded full-stack app that effectively demonstrates MongoDB's
capabilities while providing a practical and user-friendly experience.
